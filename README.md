# Data-Science-Internship-Project
Introduction:<br>
The "Amazing Mart Dataset" is a comprehensive collection of structured information that offers valuable insights into consumer behavior, purchasing trends, and market dynamics. This dataset encompasses a wide range of product categories and transactional details gathered from the operations of Amazing Mart, a prominent retail chain. Researchers, analysts, and businesses can leverage this dataset to uncover patterns, make informed decisions, and develop strategies in the ever-evolving landscape of retail and consumer markets. With its rich and diverse data, the Amazing Mart Dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying market dynamics and exploring innovative approaches in the retail industry. <br>

Problem Statement: <br>
Perform EDA and derive Insights from the Amazing Mart Dataset using Various Data Analysis and Data Visualization libraries of Python such as Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn. Create and Deploy a ML Model Which can be accessed by all, using Streamlit and GitHub. <br>

Performed the following steps:<br>
1)Data Exploration <br>
2)Data Insights <br>
3)Data Cleaning and Preprocessing <br>
4)Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
5)Model Building <br>
6)Deploying the ML Model <br>

Conclusion: <br>
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting the sales of Amazing Mart based on different features. We started with exploring and cleaning the data, followed by performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Then we built and evaluated different regression models to predict sales and concluded that the XGBoost Regressor was the best model with 85% accuracy. Finally, we created an interactive Streamlit app that utilized the best model to generate predictions based on user inputs. This project highlights the importance of data analysis and modeling in making informed business decisions. By predicting sales, Amazing Mart can make better decisions regarding product promotions, inventory management, and sales strategies.
